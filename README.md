# Project 1 Portfolio Forecasting App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://streamlit.io/) 

**Welcome to our Portfolio Simulator. This was created to be able to predict the theoretical performance
of a portfolio of stocks using historical close price data and a Monte Carlo simluation.**

The simulator uses a Streamlit dashboard. A user can upload a csv file that contains the symbols of stocks they wish to pick
as well as the quantity. From their, the user will choose the start and end date range that they would like. From there, the 
user will pick how long they wish to hold their stocks. After all the parameters are set, the simulator can be started to see 
how their portoflio will perform based on the historical close price data from the date range chosen and length of time to hold
the stocks.

https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)

The Portfolio Simulator is run using a Streamlit dashboard.

To run the simulator, go to the README.md file at the following link: https://github.com/SoukP1/Project-1/blob/main/README.md

Click on the Streamlit link within the README.md file. This will take you to the Streamlit dashboard.

In order for the simulator run, you must create a csv file that contains a list of symbols of the stocks you wish to choose.
You must also include a quantity of each stock chosen. The following screenshot shows an example csv file. Your csv file
must match the format of the example.

Once you have your csv file, upload the file to the Streamlit dashboard section that says "upload file".

After the csv file has been uploaded, choose the beginning and end date of historical data you wish to pull. From there, 
choose the length of time you wish to hold your stock.

Once all the parameters have been completed, click "run" for the simulator to execute. After the simulator finishes running,
the results of the simulator and a visual graph will display.
